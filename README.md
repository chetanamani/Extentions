# Extentions
To identify and remove suspicious browser extensions, 
begin by opening the extensions or add-ons manager in the browser. 
This section allows to view all the currently installed extensions.  
Carefully examine each one, checking whether you recognize it or have intentionally installed it.
Pay special attention to extensions you don't remember adding or those that seem unnecessary. 

For each extension, review its permissions — for example, if a simple extension is asking for access to all websites or browser history, that’s a red flag. 

You can also look up the extension in the web store or online to read reviews and see if others have reported it as malicious.
If you find any extension that is unused, unknown, or seems suspicious based on its permissions or reputation, proceed to remove it immediately from the browser. 
After removing the suspicious extensions, restart the browser to ensure the changes take effect.
Observe any performance improvements or behavioral changes in the browser such as fewer pop-ups, reduced CPU usage, or fewer redirects. 
Finally, research how malicious extensions can affect users — many are capable of tracking user activity, injecting ads, stealing personal information, or redirecting traffic to phishing sites.
This step strengthens browser security and helps maintain a smooth and safe browsing experience.
